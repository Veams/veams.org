### Generate Custom Components

You want to create a component from scratch? No problem at all!

`VEAMS` gives you the flexibility to create components based on what we called __blueprints__.
You can see the default blueprint in action by executing: 

``` bash 
veams generate component my-first-component
```
Answer the prompts and you can start to work with your first `VEAMS` component.
